## Solution
Analyzing the binary with [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra'), with little effort we can understand that the service generates a random `user_id` and after printing it, it asks us to enter the `serial_key`. This `key` is calculated through a static algorithm starting from the `user id`. Being that our `user id` is shown to us we can replicate the algorithm (that's what `exploit.c` does) and calculate the correct `serial key` starting from our `id`. 
Did that, after sending the *serial key* we calculated to the service, the flag will be printed.

## Flag 
`flag{3z_l1c3n53_4_3v3ry0n3}`
