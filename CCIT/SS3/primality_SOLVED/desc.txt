Really Optimized Primality test is a service that can tell you whether a number

is prime or not.

Well, being extremely optimized, if the service tells you that a number is not

a prime then you can be sure, otherwise well... let's say it depends ;)

Anyway, the flag is in the usual place. Can you read the flag?
